### How I am going to complete this assignment

- Get started with the frontend work. You can use the same styles/interface layout in your OG covid tracker app. Use only bootstrap CDN and your own CSS styles for the UI.

- Fetch Data from the API and show a table of countries with the covid numbers.

- Use chart js for designing the timeline charts.

- If you have time, create a simple node/express app that stores data from the API in a MySQL database(use node-mysql package for connecting to the DB). 

- It will refresh covid data in the DB only once every 24 hours, that is send a request to the API for the updated numbers
